		<h1 class="home-title">Hello. My name is Jordan Keen. I am a Front-End Developer based in Toronto, ON. In a short summary, I am a passionate self-motivated individual who thrives off of living “goal oriented”. In the past, I have pursued many different directions in life which have led to a surplus of experience. I'd love to tell you more but in the meantime.. here is one of my favorite quotes at the moment. "Lateral thinking is about getting in the mindset of breaking the rules that aren’t really rules; they’re just the way things have been conventionally done in the past".</h1>
